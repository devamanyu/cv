I am a second year Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I am advised by Prof. Roger Zimmermann and a member of the Media Management Research Lab. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from National Institute of Technology, Warangal where I received the Department Gold Medal.

My interests span the fields of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Primarily, I research in Multimodal Affective Computing with an emphasis on exploring emotion dynamics in conversational videos and understanding sarcasm in text.
